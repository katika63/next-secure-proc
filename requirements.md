# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating an existing HTML-based cybersecurity website with integrated AI chat functionality to a modern Next.js application. The current site includes multiple static HTML pages, a comprehensive AI chat UI with Gemini API integration, styling assets, and various service pages. The migration should preserve all existing functionality while modernizing the architecture for better performance, maintainability, and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to access all existing pages and content through the new Next.js application, so that I can continue to find the same information and services without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any existing page URL THEN the system SHALL serve the equivalent Next.js page with identical content
2. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL provide smooth client-side routing
3. WHEN a user accesses the site THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing visual styling and layout
4. WHEN a user views any page THEN the system SHALL display all images, assets, and media correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to use the AI chat functionality seamlessly within the new Next.js application, so that I can continue to interact with the AI assistant without any loss of features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the AI chat interface THEN the system SHALL provide all existing chat functionality
2. WHEN a user sends a message to the AI THEN the system SHALL connect to the Gemini API and return responses
3. WHEN a user interacts with authentication features THEN the system SHALL maintain Supabase integration
4. WHEN a user uses the chat THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing UI components and styling
5. WHEN a user accesses debug or test features THEN the system SHALL maintain development tools functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migrated application to follow Next.js best practices and modern React patterns, so that the codebase is maintainable and scalable for future development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use Next.js App Router for routing
2. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL follow React component best practices
3. WHEN pages are structured THEN the system SHALL use proper Next.js page organization
4. WHEN styling is implemented THEN the system SHALL use CSS modules or styled-components for component-scoped styles
5. WHEN API routes are needed THEN the system SHALL use Next.js API routes instead of separate server files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want the new Next.js application to maintain all existing API integrations and server functionality, so that backend services continue to work without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL maintain existing Gemini API integration
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL preserve Supabase connectivity
3. WHEN server-side functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL use Next.js API routes
4. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL properly configure Next.js environment handling
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL not require the separate Express server

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the new Next.js application to load faster and provide better performance than the current HTML site, so that I have an improved browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL utilize Next.js automatic code splitting
2. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL use Next.js Image optimization
3. WHEN the site is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide faster initial page loads through SSR/SSG
4. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL prefetch linked pages for instant navigation
5. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL achieve better Core Web Vitals scores than the current site

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to preserve the existing project structure and organization where possible, so that the transition is smooth and familiar code patterns are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL organize pages in a logical Next.js structure
2. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL group related functionality appropriately
3. WHEN assets are migrated THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing asset organization
4. WHEN styling is converted THEN the system SHALL preserve the current design system and CSS structure
5. WHEN the AI chat functionality is migrated THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing service layer architecture

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want all existing content, including blog posts, service pages, and static content, to be properly migrated and accessible, so that no information is lost during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blog pages are accessed THEN the system SHALL display all existing blog content
2. WHEN service pages are viewed THEN the system SHALL show all service descriptions and details
3. WHEN static pages are loaded THEN the system SHALL present all existing static content
4. WHEN navigation is used THEN the system SHALL provide access to all migrated pages
5. WHEN SEO is considered THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve existing meta tags and SEO structure
